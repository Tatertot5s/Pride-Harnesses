Retextures the happy ghast harnesses to be of pride flag colors!

Someone else has done a similar pack already, but I didn't see it until after I had made mine. Mine is sligly different as it has a different set of flags and it has item textures. Go support their pack! [https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pride-ghast](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pride-ghast)
